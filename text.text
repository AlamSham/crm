tracking number and shipment information to customers
All customer information—such as shipped materials, invoices, samples provided, tracking numbers, and other relevant details—should be consolidated in one place. When we search for a customer, their complete history and progress should be readily available, making it easy for anyone to understand their status at a glance. Additionally, customers should be categorized as hot, cold, or follow-up customers, with the ability to search by these categories as well.
